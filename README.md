Russian-English transliteration tool
![Screenshot_2024-01-19-21-33-39-962_com android chrome-edit](https://github.com/M3351AN/Russklish/assets/65479796/2c452356-3fa9-47b2-9965-c79090c09001)

## How it works
By comparing the corresponding letter combinations in the pronunciation list. Its advantage is that it does not call any third-party APIs. The code runs completely in your browser, and the results can output immediately, and your information will not be leaked at all. Butt transliteration results are not entirely accurate

## What's it for
- Transliterate some proper nouns
- Try communicating in Russian when only ASCII is available
- Help Russo beginners practice pronunciation
- Expose "fake russki" who only use translator
- memes (maybe?)

Not just for Russian, the tool has some compatibility between any Cyrillic and Germanic languages

## Credits
Thanks to Bing copilot for collecting pronunciation comparison list.

## Not very grateful
MI AI refuses to collect pronunciation tables for me
- “我可能无法提供俄文英文发音对照表，因为这需要大量的内容和专业知识。你可以在网上搜索相关资源或者使用语言学习应用来帮助你学习和比较两种语言的发音。”
